## Preparations

All three methods require a short preliminary setup on Mac's local hostname. This will be used as an alias to `localhost` and will be typed as the web address on mobile. So let's set up your local host:

1. Go to **System Preferences > Sharing**
2. Near the "Computers on your local network..." text, click the **Edit** button
3. Add your preferred name, like `yourname.local`
4. Use this name instead of `localhost` everywhere in your workflow

## Using MAMP

1. Fire up MAMP and hit **Start Servers**
2. Connect your iphone to your Mac with an **USB**
3. Go to **System Preferences > Sharing**
4. From the left side menu, select **Internet sharing**
5. On the right side, check **iPhone USB**
6. Check the **Internet sharing** checkbox
7. If an insurance prompt window appears, go on with **Start**

Now grab your iphone and go to h`ttp://yourname.local` in a web browser. You will see that the contents of your MAMP folder is shown, containing with your local sites.

### Using WordPress

If you would like to use with local WordPress sites, just repeat the steps above, and change the WordPress `Site URL` and `Page URL` settings according to your Mac's host name.

For example: let's say that your local WordPress install is at `http://localhost/mysite`. We need to change this url, so go to **Dashboard > Settings > General** and change the Page and Site URL to `http://yourname.local/mysite` where `name.local` is your local Mac host name and `mysite` is the WordPress folder.

> > Now check your custom link on your iphone, and see that your WordPresss site appears.

## Using Jekyll

Jekyll serve doesnâ€™t expose the site on the local network (for security reasons), but you can open it with using the `--host` flag. Use `0.0.0.0` to bind the local IP address of the host:

```shell
bundle exec jekyll serve --host 0.0.0.0
```

> > If a prompt comes up with "do you accept incoming network connections", just hit **Allow**

Type your local Mac host name in your iPhone's web address bar in Safari, and add the Jekyll port after the url (it is `:4000` by default). Now you can visit your site from any device on the local network, like `http://yourname.local:4000`

## Troubleshooting

I ran into an issue when using this method with MAMP: everything was set up correctly, `hostname.local/website` showed the requested local content on a computer, but when I tried to access it from my iphone, it refused to load the page.

After a bit digging into this, I found out that the problem is the Mac firewall blocks the site from being rendered on mobile. To fix this, follow these steps:

1. Go to **System Preferences > Security & Privacy**
2. Select the **Firewall** tab and click on **Firewall Options**
3. You might need to click on the **lock** icon to unlock modifications
4. With the `+` button, add **MAMP** as an exception
5. Make sure that **MAMP** is "Allowing incoming connections"
